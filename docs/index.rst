Python OPC-UA Documentation
=========================================

Pure Python OPC-UA / IEC 62541 Client and Server Python 2, 3 and pypy .
http://freeopcua.github.io/, https://github.com/FreeOpcUa/python-opcua

OPC-UA implementation is quasi complete and has been tested against many different OPC-UA stacks. API offers both a low level interface to send and receive all UA defined structures and high level classes allowing to write a server or a client in a few lines. It is easy to mix high level objects and low level UA calls in one application.

Most code is autogenerated from xml specification using same code as the one that is used for freeopcua C++ client and server, thus adding missing functionnality to client and server shoud be trivial.


Some documentation is available at http://python-opcua.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
